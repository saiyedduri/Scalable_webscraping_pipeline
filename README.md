# How to Search for Sectors in Europages
1. **Identify the sector keyword**
Examples: "winery", "machinery", "organic food", "IT services".
2. **Find the base URL on Europages**
   Example:https://www.europages.com/companies/winery.html
3. **Configure DirectoryConfig** (in core_datastructures.py)
   Example:
   from core_datastructures import DirectoryConfig
      
      config = DirectoryConfig(
          name="Winery Sector",
          base_url="https://www.europages.com/companies/winery.html",
          sector_link=".company-name a",  # CSS selector for profile links
          paginatation_selector=".pagination a",
          max_pages=5,
          rate_limit_seconds=2.0)
   
  5. **Scrape company profiles**
        - Loop through sector pages.
        - Extract CompanyInfo objects.
  6. Validate & filter contact details
     Example: 
     from contact_details_validation import ContactValidator
    
    validator = ContactValidator(custom_business_domains={"winery", "vineyard"})
    is_valid = validator.email.is_valid_email("info@winery-example.com")
    is_business = validator.email.is_business_email("info@winery-example.com")
    
  7. Clean data
     from DataProcessor import DataProcessor

    companies = DataProcessor.deduplicate_companies(companies)
    companies = DataProcessor.deduplicate_emails(companies)
